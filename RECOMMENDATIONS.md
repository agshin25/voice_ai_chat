# Voice AI Chat — Feature Recommendations

## High Impact, Easy to Add
1. **Interruption support** — User speaks while AI is talking → stop AI audio, process new input
2. **Conversation memory/context display** — Sidebar showing what AI "remembers"
3. **Response time metrics** — Show live timing: STT, LLM, TTS, Total on screen
4. **Language auto-detection badge** — Show detected language next to each message

## Medium Effort, Very Impressive
5. **Voice selection** — Dropdown to pick AI voice (alloy, echo, fable, nova, onyx, shimmer)
6. **Conversation export** — Download chat as JSON/text
7. **Typing indicator animation** — Pulsing "..." that morphs into text during ai_chunk
8. **Dark/light mode** — Quick win with Tailwind

## High Effort, Most Impressive
9. **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** — Upload PDF, AI answers questions about it via voice
10. **Function calling / tool use** — AI can check weather, do math, search web via voice
11. **Emotion detection** — Analyze voice tone, display mood indicator

## Priority for Presentation
- #1 (interruption) + #3 (timing metrics) + #5 (voice selection) = quick, visual, impressive
- #9 (RAG) if time allows = senior-level impressive
